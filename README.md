## bp2832a LED driver schematic

This is a bp2832a LED driver chip schematic drawn in KiCAD.

###### Getting started
A LED lamp in my hallway was broken and I fixed it. In the process I also drew the schematic of the LED power supply - a buck converter.

See the YT video here: https://youtu.be/8gsGQcXcpWg
The KiCad version I used: 5.0.2-bee76a0~70~ubuntu14.04.1, release build

Thank you!
